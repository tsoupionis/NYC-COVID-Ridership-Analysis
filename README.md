# NYC COVID-Ridership Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between COVID-19 case trends and public transportation ridership in New York City. It involves an analysis of daily COVID-19 case counts and MTA ridership data to understand how the pandemic has impacted urban mobility and to investigate potential correlations between the spread of the virus and public transit usage.

## Data Sources
- COVID-19 Daily Counts of Cases, Hospitalizations, and Deaths in NYC. 
- MTA Daily Ridership Data (Beginning 2020).

## Tools and Libraries Used
- R for data processing and analysis.
- Libraries: dplyr, ggplot2, lubridate, tidyr.

## Data Processing and Analysis
- Conversion of date formats for consistency.
- Aggregation of COVID-19 data to determine total daily cases in NYC.
- Transformation of ridership data and handling of missing values.
- Merging datasets based on dates for comparative analysis.
- Correlation analysis to explore the relationship between COVID-19 cases and ridership.
- Visualization of trends and correlations using various ggplot2 techniques.

## Key Findings and Interpretations
- A very weak positive linear correlation was observed between COVID-19 cases and total ridership.
- The visualizations suggest a more nuanced relationship than expected, indicating that factors other than public transportation usage play a significant role in the spread of the pandemic.
- The analysis also highlights the complexity of urban mobility patterns and the influence of various external factors.
